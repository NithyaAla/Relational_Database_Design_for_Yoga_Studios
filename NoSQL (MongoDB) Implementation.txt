Connect to the server via Mongo daemon and open a mongo shell connected to a locally-installed MongoDB instance running on port 27017.
Create ‘yogastudio’ database.
Create 3 collections namely trainers, trains, and satisfaction using the db.createCollection()  command.
Insert the records using db.collectionname.insert() command and display the records in each collection using db.collection.find() command.
Perform the following queries:
1. Query to find the number of trainers who conducted more than 55 sessions using $match and $gt functions:
db.trainers.aggregate([{$match: {number_of_sessions: {$gt: 55}}}])
2. Query to find how many students each trainer has trained using aggregate functions $group, $count and $sum:
db.trains.aggregate([{$group : {_id : "$trainer_id", count: {$sum:1}}}])
3. Query to update the rating of a trainer as Y or N based on the score field in satisfaction collection using $set and $cond functions:
(If score >= 3, set as Y, else N)
db.satisfaction.aggregate([{$set : {"Y_or_N" : {$cond: {if: {$gt : ['$score', 2]}, then : "Y", else: "N"}}}}, {$out: 'satisfaction'}])
View the ratings of trainers from updated satisfaction collection using db.satisfaction.find() command.
